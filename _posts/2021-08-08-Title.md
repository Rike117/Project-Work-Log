On Sunday-08 I continued to work on my research paper. I continued to work on my abstract and introduction sections as well as the testing and heating procedures. I also went ahead and
created the other sections that I would be working on the future like the cooling procedures and results and conclusion. This work period took about 3 hours and 25 minutes.
