On Tueday-10 I had a meeting with professor Stark at 11:00am which lasted about 2 hours. During that time we discussed the progress of the project and I showed him how my report was turning out.
I also showed him some of the data analysis and plots that I did in excel for the data gathered from the Kestrel logger. But the bulk of the meeting was spent working on the Matlab
code and making sure it was working correctly. We had to alter some of the code for the All chargers scenario by taking out and adding in some state mahchines that update the batteries
and chargers correctly. We also noticed an issue in the two battery scenario where the chargers werent being updated correctly and only one charger was being used even though two were available.
We also made some changes to the batetry arrays and the bar graphs that were created. Once the meeting concluded I continued to work on my report and added some of the plots I created in excel.
I also continued to do some data analysis. This work period last about 4 hours and 23 minutes on top of the two hour meeting.
