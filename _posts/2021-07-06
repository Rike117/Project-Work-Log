At 11:00 am I had a 1 hour and 14 minute long meeting with proffersor Stark. Where we discussed the projects progress and some changes that needed to be made to our excel file.
Continually, after the meeting I continued to modify the excel file to facilitate calculations. The main goal was to only type data into a few cells and have that information
propagate through all the sheets doing the necessary calculations. I worked on this task for about 2 hours.
