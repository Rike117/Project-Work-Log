On Friday 20, 2021 I drove to the Mesa Lab which took me about an hour and 55 minutes. Upon arrival me and Daniel started setting up the equipment and began testing. 
From some reason when cooling the batteries in the Lipo Bag they cooled down substantially quicker than the previous runs and I wasnt quite sure why this was the case. 
So I decided to do another run with the Lipo Bag which yeilded results similar to before. The only differences that I could define from the two runs was that the batteries were
a bit hotter than the first run that day and that the bag was fully closed on the second run. This leads me to belive that if the bag were open that the batteries would cool much 
quicker which can be confirmed by the batteries cooling down quicker without the bag in an air conditioned room. But again things pretty much were the same as the previous day.
This lab work period last about 7 hours and 43 minutes.
