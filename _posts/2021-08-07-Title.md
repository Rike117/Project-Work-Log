On Saturday-07 I watched a couple more paper formating Latex videos which showed me how to create an abstract section with borders as well as how to deal with indexing.
I also learned about sectioning and subsectioning as well as adding images in latex. I also started writing my paper I worked on my abstract and introduction. 
This work period lasted about 3 hours and 50 minutes.
