Today I tried to implement what I learned about object oriented programming by creating a battery class as well some code to simulate the battery cooling process. The properties 
portion of the class consisted of InUse, cooling, charging, charged, and ready. While the methods consisted of cooling, charging, and charged. While in the simulation code
I defined all the necessary properties like charge time, cool time, and flight time. From there I attempted to create an array of batteries so that the simulation could be run
with different scenarios. I forgot to mention that my code was based of the starting point code that professor Stark provided me but unfortunalety I could not get it work properly.
I kept receiving a slew of error. So, I decided to email Proffesor Stark and ask for his input. This work period lasted about two hours and 45 minutes.
