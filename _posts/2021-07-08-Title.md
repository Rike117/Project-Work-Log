Proffesor Stark brought it to my attention that I was still hard coding some date into the table I created to visualize the cool down and charging proccess for our project. 
He suggested to look for different alternatives to accomplish this. So I researched videos and online to tutorials to see I macros and VBA could be used to this more effieciently.
Furhtermore, I also looked into utilizeing ghant chart templates to do this but I was not very succesful. Further, research and tinkering still needs to be done. 
I worked on this issue for about 3 hours.
