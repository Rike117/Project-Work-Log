Today I had a zoom meetting with Professor Stark which started at 11:00 and lasted an hour. In this meeting we disscused the simulation code we have been working on and what our
next steps would be. I was tasked with being able to run all the simulations from a single script of code as well as save the data and present it in an excel sheet. Furhtermore, I
was also tasked to find a way to run the simulation for many different scenarios in one go. Continually, we also disscussed about the status of the lab equipments and when we
would be able to do in person work.
