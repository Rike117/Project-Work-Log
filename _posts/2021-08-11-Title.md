On Wednesday-11 I drove to the Mesa Lab which took me about 1 hour and 49 minutes. I met up with Professor Stark at around 9:45am so that I could participate in another research project. 
Which consisted of me doing a drone flight simulator while I verbally described my thought process and what I was doing. After that was done I spoke with Professor Stark
about our Matlab code and how the data should be presented in the report and he told me to use the bar graphs I created as well as creating some tables in excel. So I created a 
series of tables in excel and showed them to him and then we disscused which tables I should integrate into my report and how I should go about talking about them in the report.
Then I wanted to clarify my thought process and I how interpreted what he had told to see if our thought process were aligned. Once I was satisfied with my understanding of the
issue of describing the data on the report I headed home which was at around 12:45pm. The drive home lasted about an hour and 57 minutes. Upon my arrival back home I continued to
work on the tables and including them in my report. I also continued working on the results sections of my report. This work period lasted about 2 hours and 25 minutes.
