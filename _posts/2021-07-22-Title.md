Today I continued to trouble shoot the issue I had yesterday. After staring at the code for about thirty minutes and seeing nothing wrong with it I decided to just look up the error
online. And apparently having "clear" & "clc" at the top of your code when trying to create a function is detremental to the code and wont let it work properly. Once I removed those
to pieces of code the rest of the code started to function properly. With that out of the way I made the remaining scripts into functions. The following issue was figuring out
how to call the functions out from a single script. I stuggled with this for a bit but I figured out that you write the functions into the script. So, just wrote the function
name and then placed the input variables into parenthesis. You have to have the variables defined before the function code and once I did that the code began to work. But it 
was not functioning exactly the way I wanted it to. So, I reviewed some of the code and found syntax errors but I was not able to find all of them and decided to continue the work
tomorrow. This work period lasted about 2 hours and 53 minutes.
