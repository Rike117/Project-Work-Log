On Friday 06 I continued to watch Latex tutorials I started watching tutorials on how to create tables in latex in order to present my data in a clear and concise fashion.
I also watched Latex tutorials on how to format papers correctly like the spacing, indexing, and margins. This work period lasted about 3 hours and 15 minutes.
