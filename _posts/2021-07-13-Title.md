I had an hour long meeting with proffesor Stark via zoom that started at 11:00 Am. In the meeting we disscused how our in person work was being delayed due too unforeseen circumstances.
We also disscused about the excel sheet created to simulate the experiment having flaws with certain time range values and how it might be a better idea to use matlab to do this.
Furtermore, via matlab one could utilize Object-Oriented Programming to simulate the battery cooling experiment by creating a series of classes and applying them to some simulation code.
Proffessor Stark provided a some ideas and a starting point from writing the code and subsequently our meeting concluded.
