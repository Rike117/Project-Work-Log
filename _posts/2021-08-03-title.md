On Tuesday-03 I meet with professor Stark at 12:00am for about an hour via Zoom. In the meeting we disccussed how the experiments were going and what the preliminary results were looking like.
We also discussed the Matlab code and some more changes that needed to be made like some changes for the All charger method in which the state machines need to be changed in order to 
properly simulate the situation. We also discussed what format should be used to right the final report and professor Stark suggested that I should use Latex to write my report.
He then showed me some reports that he wrote in latex and he also showed me what programs he used. He also stated that he wasnt too worried on the format of the paper as long as it
was presentable and that there wasnt a word or page limit as long as the paper gets the main point across. After the meeting concluded I looked into the programs I needed to download
to write my paper in Latex. I found out that I had to download MikTek and Texmaker and that I had to dowload MikTek first or else TexMaker would not work properly which I did not
do the first time around so I had to uninstall both programs and install them properly the second time. After I downloaded everything correclty I watched a couple tutorials covering
the basics of Latex. This work period lasted about 3 hours and 30 minutes.
