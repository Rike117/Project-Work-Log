On Sunday I continued to read and make comments on the code to better understand it. Then I began writing more code using the code provided as a template. The code provided only
simulated the experiment when only one charger is available. So, I had to modify the code to simulate the following scenarios no charger, two chargers, and all chargers.
To do this I had to add more chargers into the simulation and at first I thought I had to make a class for each battery but after furhter thought that did not make any sense.
Since, all the chargers have all the same functions in properties there is no need to make more classes. So when adding the chargers I just linked them the charger class and charger status class.
So, to actually add the chargers into the code I had to add if statements defining the functions of the chargers and how they would proceed which in the end was not very complicated. 
The main problem was understanding how to portray the experiment in code. I was only able to complete the code for the two charger scenario but I kept obtaining an error and wasnt 
able to figure out what it was. So, I decided to work on it some more the next day. On Sunday I worked on the code for a total of 4 hours and 12 minutes.
