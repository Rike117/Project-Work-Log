Modified the excel sheet so that one only needs to input the raw data into one sheet and have excel do the calculations automatically.
I also created 6 cost savings table highlights the cost vs time aspect of each cooling method. Subsequently, I created bar graphs to help visualize the affect that eache 
method had on the cost and time. I also had to check that all the calculations were being done correctly and if they made sense. Furthermore, I also had to take out and add in
some columns to the excel sheet in order to make more user friendly and easy to understand. This process took me about 3 hours.
