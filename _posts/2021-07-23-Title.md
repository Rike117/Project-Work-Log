Today I worked on fixing the issues that I wasnt able to solve yesterday. I had to fix a few syntax issues as well as renaming a few variables since some scenarios are different and some
of their values for the same varible are different for example the number of chargers is different for each scenario. So I had to go through all the scripts of code and rename 
a couple of variables. From there the code seemded to function properly and the next step was to have the code run for any number set of batteries but I was unable to do this.
So, I decided to email professor Stark to see if he could provide any assistance. This work period lasted about 2 hours and 36 minutes.
