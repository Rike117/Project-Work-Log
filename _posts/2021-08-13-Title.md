On Friday-13 I worked on the final touches of my report. I continued to finalize my results from simulation and finalize the conlusion. Then I reread through my report and corrected
any spelling or grammatical errors I made along the way. I also altered the formatting of my graphs so they take up less space. I also reviewed the Matlab code one last time to make
sure everything was working in order. I also went through everyhting that I was going to turn in to make sure I was satisfied with my work. I also sent my report to a friend for a peer review
and made some changes that they suggested as well as corrected some errors that they pointed out and I also made some formatting changes to my report. I basically gave all my work a once over to make sure everthing was done correctly so that I 
could turn it in. Todays last and final period was the most arduous one which lasted about 7 hours and 45 minutes.
