Today I took a break from finding a better way to visualize the wait time table alternative. Instead I decided to look at the formulas I used in the wait time table and see
where exaclty I was hard coding the data. I also wanted to see if my tables would be greatly affect by different cooling, charging, and flight times. I found out that in for 
certain time ranges the tables produce good results but then once that threshold is passed the tables are not very help. I know I could modify the tables to fit the different
wait times but that method could prove time consuming. Moreover, I continued to analyze the tables formulas and make changes. I worked on the project today for about 2 hours.
