On Saturday-31 I worked on the Matlab simulation code. To be more precise I was reviewing the code and making some changes that Professor Stark suggested.
For example, I was figuring out how to present the data created by the simulation in a meaningful way that would help shed soom light on what methods of cooling are the best.
I looked into presenting the data in scatter plots, line grapsh, and bar graphs. But I'm still a little uncertain which way is the best since there is alot of data and it can be
daunting at first glance. I also looked into creating a powerpoint presentation via Matlab but I'm still a little unsure about it. I worked on the Matlab code for about 3 hours nad 48 minutes.
