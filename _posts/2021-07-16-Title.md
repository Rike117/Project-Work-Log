Today I continued to work on the simulation code and class code but I didnt make any worth while progress. I did some more research on object oriented programming hoping to
find the answer to my issues but I did not. So, I decided to wait for Professors Stark's response. I recieved Professor Starks response later in the day but I was unable to
read it until tomorrow. This work period lasted about an 1 hour and 37 minutes.
