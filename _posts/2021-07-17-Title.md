On Saturday I was able to read Professors Stark's Response in which he provided further insight and some template code that I could modify furhter. But I just read through
the code to try and understand it better as well as making comments along the way to furhter explain and understand what the code was doing. I did this for the 5 coding files he 
provided which consisted of simulation code and four different class codes for the batteries and chargers. This is when I realized where I was going wrong previously. I was not 
defining all the classes necessary as well as the whole simulation. I needed to delve further into the proccess and be more descriptive of the whole proccess.
On Saturday I worked for about 2 hours and 39 minutes.
