Today I researched methods on how to control many scripts from a single script. I found a method which was very simple but it would run a script and then procede to to run
the following script and overwrite the previous scripts data which is not very helpful in my case. I continued doing research and founs that you can create a class and have it
run the simulations for you but to my understanding this methods is a bit excessive. After playing with the code a for it I figured we can just make the simulation scripts into 
functions and call out those functions from one script. So, I attempted to make the first file into a function but I kept running into errors. I referenced some previous work
that I have done and my code seemed to be written correctly. I wasnt able to trouble shoot the issue so I decided to work on it a little more tommorow. This work period lasted
around 3 hours and 17 minutes.
