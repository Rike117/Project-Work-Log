I continued working on finding a solution to yesterdays issue which was finding a more effecient way to visualize the wait times for the charging and cooling procces.
I keep running into issues with the ghant chart template code and getting it to do what I want it to. I watched a few more tutorial videos to see if they could help but they
didnt really help. I didnt make much progress today but I'm sure a solution will be found soon.
