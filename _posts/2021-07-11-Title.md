So, today I continued my attempt to fix the excel wait time table. I was able to fix the hard coding issue but I had to copy and paste my tables on another sheet in order to not mess up the tables I already crreated. I did this to not ruin the work I have already done. Once finished I would only have to copy and paste the tables into my sheets with the improved formulas. I also attempted to create a log book for my work in github. I had to review a tutorial I had done previosuly to refresh my mempory and facilitate the whole process. Once the basic blueprint for the page was created I had to transfer my posts to the log book page. I did have a bit of trouble with the formating and typos but those were easily worked out after reviewing the errors page. Today I worked on the project for about 3 and a half hours.
