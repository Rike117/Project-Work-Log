On Tuesday 21, 2021 I had a meeting with professor Stark at 11:00 Am which lasted in hour. During this meeting we talked about the simulation code and the changes that have been made
and the changes that need to be done. Some of those changes conisted of trying to create a report and presentation from within Matlab that consists of the data gathered from the simulations.
When then discussed our first lab day that would occur the following day at the Mesa Lab. We went over what equipment was available and at what time a place we would meet up. Once
the meeting ended I continued working on the Matlab code where I began implementing some changes the Proffesor Stark suggested in which I rewrote my function code so that I could run
all the simulation scenarios from one script in a more efficient manner. The coding period took about an hour and a half.
