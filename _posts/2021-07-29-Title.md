On Thursday 29, 2021 I drove to the Mesa lab which took me an hour and 55 minutes. Upon arrival I meet up with Daniel and we began setting up the equipment to begin our work. We began
similarly to the previous day. We began by heating up the batteries and once they reached the required temperature we took them out of the food warmer and observed how long it
took the batteries to reach ambient temperature. We basically did the same exact proccess as the previous day and data collected was pretty much the same. The lab work period took about 7 hours
and 47 minutes.
