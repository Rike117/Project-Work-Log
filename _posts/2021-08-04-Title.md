On Wednesday-04 I continued familarizing myself with Latex via Latex tutorials on youtube where I would follow along and practice the various excercises done. 
The tuturials went over how to write math formulas correctly in math mode and how to format your text correctly. I was basically doing a crash course on Latex since I dont have much time to learn it. 
I worked on this for about 2 hours and 55 minutes.
