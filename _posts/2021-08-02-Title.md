On Monday 01 I drove to the mesa lab which took me about an hour and 50 minutes. I went to the lab to meet up with Daniel at around 1:30pm to discuss the data we aquired and to see if it made sense.
As well as to double check if we needed to make any additional runs once we verified the validity of our data. Once the validity of our data was confirmed I commenced to work on the Matlab code.
To be more precise I worked on presenting the data gathered from the simulations into a power point presentaion. But since I was working on my laptop I had to download Matlab and the 
proper packages to do so. Once that was done I began to read Matlab documentation on how to create a presentation via Matlab and to add slides, titles, and data. During this time
Daniel worked on gathering some data for his tablet experiment and he required some assistance throughout the day to set up his test runs. But once he was done at around 5:15 we called it a day.
So in total we worked for about 3 hours and 45 minutes that day. Then I drove home which took 1 hour and 40 minutes.
