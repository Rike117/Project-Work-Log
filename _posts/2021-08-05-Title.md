On Thurday 05 I drove to Mesa lab which took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes. I went to meet up with Daniel at around 2:00pm since he still needed to get some work down for his assignment and
he required some assistance with his work. During my time in the lab I continued to work on the Matlab code and figureing out ways to present the data in an easy to understand
manner. I decided to present the flight time, field time, up time, and total costs in bar graphs so that it is easy to see what impact batteries and chargers have on the cooling methods. 
I also worked on being able to get the Matlab graphs on to a powerpoint presentaion via Matlab. I had to read various Matlab documentations but I was able to figure it out.
I also watched some Latex tutorials and followed along the exercises that were being done in order to further familierize myself with Latex. But I did have some trouble at first
since I was working on my laptop again I had to download the latex programs again but I did it incorreclty once more since I didnt know I had to download the mobile version of
Texmaker for it to work on my laptop. At around 5:15pm me and Daniel decided to call it a day. So, I drove home which took me about 1 hour 43 minutes.
